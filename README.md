You are going to stick the number of your room on the door. The shop near your house suggests
wonderful sets of plastic digits. Each set contains exactly ten digits - one of each digit between 0 and 9,
inclusive. Return the number of sets required to write your room number. Note that 6 can be used as 9
and vice versa.
